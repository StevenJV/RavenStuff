RavenStuff
==========

a bunch of RavenDB spikes, packaged into one solution

RavenDocument - class(es) used by the other projects
RMDB - an MVC app which uses everything else. 

* Once this project is more mature, these projects will go away and all functionality will be in the RMDB MVC App: 
WriteToRaven - command-line project to create Movie documents
ReadFromRaven - reads a document & dumps to command window. 
ActorsFromMovies - reads each Movie in the database and creates/updates Actor documents 
EditMovie - a simple spike which reads from Raven, changes the object, then writes back.
